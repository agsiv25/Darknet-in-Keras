# Darknet-in-Keras
The neural network framework DarkNet is coded in C to implement YOLO object detection. This is a rough implementation of this framework utilizing Keras and Tensorflow. The end goal of this program is to be able to classify the lung x-ray images of possible COVID-19 patients. The dataset was compiled from a number of sources.
